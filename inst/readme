The instances with 8, 20, 50 customers were directly from 'Doppstadt C, Koberstein A, Vigo D, 2019 The hybrid electric vehicleâ€”traveling salesman problem with time windows instances. Mendeley Dataset, URL doi:10.17632/9j3tt84hyx.1.'.

The instances with 30 and 40 customers are chosen from the instances with 50 customers.

The instances with 60, 70, and 80 customers are derived from the instances with 50 customers by adding additional customers who are randomly generated within the delivery area.

Note: The elevation of each customer location is randomly generated between 0 and 100 meters
