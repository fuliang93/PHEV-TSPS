# PHEV-TSPS
Codes and instances used for Paper 'Modeling and Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem for a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Considering Speed Optimization"

# Codes
All codes were implemented in Python using the Gurobi solver. 

para.py : parameters used for the model; 

phev_tsps.py : the solution method for the original PHEV-TSPS without valid inequalities;

phev_tsps_vi.py : the solution method for the PHEV-TSPS with valid inequalities;

phev_tspsd_vi.py : the solution method for the PHEV-TSPSD with valid inequalities;

phev_tsps_cha_vi.py : the solution method for the PHEV-TSPS-CS with valid inequalities.

# Inst
The instances with 8, 20, 30, 40, 50 customers are from 'Doppstadt C, Koberstein A, Vigo D, 2019 The hybrid electric vehicleâ€”traveling salesman problem with time windows instances. Mendeley Dataset, URL doi:10.17632/9j3tt84hyx.1.', the instances with 60, 70, 80 are generated based on the former instances. Here, the elevation of each customer location is randomly generated between 0 and 100 meters.

# Inst2
These instances are similar to Inst but differ in terms of customer elevations. For the instances with the last number 2, customer elevations are randomly generated between 0 and 200 meters, while for the instances with the last number 3, customer elevations are randomly generated between 0 and 300 meters.
